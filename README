    "It's a twisted cosmic joke that in order to shave a Yak
     one must first forge a razor from scratch."

  wwrl is `will's wheel reinvention library.` it is a collection
  of data structures in C, many of which have been written before.

  here's what's here so far:

      vector.h
          an implementation of dynamic/growable arrays which is
          very loosely modelled after std::vector. it is implemented
          in the same macro style as the BSD queue and tree headers.

      allocator.h
          defines `struct wwrl_allocator`, which is used by the
          vector implementation.
